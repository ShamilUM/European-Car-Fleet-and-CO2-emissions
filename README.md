This project was chosen to understand the changes in the automotive market in the EU countries from 2010 to 2021, considering the 2015 Paris Agreement. By using the EU car registration dataset, we can analyze the evolution of the vehicles fleet in Europe, study the relationship between the car features and its CO2 emissions, understand whether certain countries/manufacturers produce less carbon-intensive cars and see which countries have started to switch to lower CO2 emission vehicles, by looking at the historical trend over the past 10 years.
The EU car dataset can be downloaded from: http://co2cars.apps.eea.europa.eu/ (in total 12 csv files). The dataset contains 58 000 000 records of the registered cars during 2010-2021.
